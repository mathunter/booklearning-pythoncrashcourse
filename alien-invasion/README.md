## Alien Invasion

### About

This codebase holds my version of the program "Alien Invasion" as worked through in the book "Python Crash Course, 3rd
Edition". It generally follows the code as presented in the book, but comes with changes as they help deepen my
understanding (or otherwise which come from a deeper understanding) of Python.
